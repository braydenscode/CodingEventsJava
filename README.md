Coding Events is a simple Java program made to display mock events.

At the moment Coding Events is in an non-working state. This is due to errrors that arose between follow along videos 6.1 and 6.2 relating to the introduction of Tags.

Future improvements include adding a Person class in order for users to track events they are interested in.

Potential Layout of Person Class {
int id - unique identifer
String firstname - users first name
String lastname - users last name
String email - user email
String username - users unique name
String password - user password

+ getters & setters for above fields
}
